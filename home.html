      <h2>About the Instructor</h2>
	<p>"Hello! I'm Katelyn Pfundstein, a passionate and dedicated music educator with a degree 
	    in Music Education from Olivet Nazarene University. With four enriching years of 
	    experience as a music teacher, I have had the privilege of nurturing the musical 
	    talents of countless students. Beyond my classroom endeavors, I have also spent 
	    six years honing my expertise in providing personalized and transformative 
	    private music lessons. My journey as an educator has allowed me to witness the 
	    profound impact that music can have on individuals' lives, and I am committed to 
	    fostering a love for music in every student I encounter. Through innovative 
	    teaching methods and a deep understanding of diverse musical genres, I strive to 
	    create a dynamic and engaging learning environment that empowers students to 
	    explore their creativity and unlock their full potential. Join me in the joy of 
	    music education, where we can harmonize our passion for music and cultivate a 
	    lifelong appreciation for the art form together!"</p>
